Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its performance along with improved computer speed, memory, and power.

There are many types of artificial neural networks including feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent. In general, artificial neural networks have an input layer to take in each of your features, a number of hidden layers, and an output layer.


They can be used for both regression and classification and work very well on big data.
